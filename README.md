This project uses Google AI services and requires a Gemini API key to function.

Getting Started: To run this project properly, you must obtain an API key from Google AI Studio and add it to the code.

Steps to Set Up:

Go to Google AI Studio and sign in or create an account.
Create an API key from the dashboard.
Open the project files in the GitHub repository and navigate to app.js.
Paste your API key into the first line of the app.js file as instructed in the code.
Save the file and you're all set!
⚠️ Important: Keep your API key private. Do not share it publicly or commit it to public repositories.
