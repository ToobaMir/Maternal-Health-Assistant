## 🌍 Purpose  
This project was created with a clear purpose: **to help pregnant women, especially in areas like Pakistan where access to gynecologists is limited and the doctor-to-patient ratio stands at 1:1300.** 
With over 5 million pregnancies annually and an estimated 30,000 maternal deaths due to preventable causes, **there is a pressing need for accessible, reliable maternal health resources.**
AI Maternal Health Assistant aims to fill that gap by offering timely and personalized support so women can safely navigate their pregnancy journey.
